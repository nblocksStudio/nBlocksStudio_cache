# nBlocksStudioCache
This repository is for the "user_data.json" file that contains all the nBlocksStudio Nodes metadata.  
It is usually created at translation time from a Diagram to Code, pulling data from the database in studio server.    
This user_data.json instance is manually maintained in case access to the server is not possible,   
or to support experimentation with new Nodes.
